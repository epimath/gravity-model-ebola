This project uses a gravity model framework to examine spatial transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa (2014-2016), at both the country and district levels. This repository currently includes the 3-patch country level model and the deterministic implementation for the 63-patch district level model. (We will update soon with code for the stochastic implementation of the 63-patch district level model as well). Please cite the paper referenced above if you use our code or adapt it for your project.
